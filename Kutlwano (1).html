     <h2> exhausting saturday</h2>
   <p>Weekends were something I really looked forward to.From the other busy five days of school,I really got to rest on weekends but now     I can't because education is holding me tightly and there's nothing that I can do about it.On saturday I went to a meeting at             Matsukubyane Secondary School and afterwards I had to go home and wMyrite my Physical sciences homework.I was really tempted to watch     soccer and leave my homeworks  for sunday but when I thought of it properly,I couldn't because I had to go to school again on             sunday,if i can,maybe go to church and then go home and attend the Tunisi programe.So literally I don't get a day off from                 education,every day is exhausting for me.<p/>
